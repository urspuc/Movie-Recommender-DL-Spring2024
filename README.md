# Movie-Recommender-DL-Spring2024

The concept of our project will be product-driven, meaning the architecture design and functionality will be more important than some performance metric numbers that we output. So it is crucial to think about what kind of product we are going to shape our framework into, and what a on-point, non-judgemental, diversified movie recommendation system should be different from Google’s “You might also like..”. 
We are interested in movie recommendation models and want to find a NN model in this field to reimplement it for our final project. We choose the BST model because it utilizes the transformer architecture. Since Transformers are SOA models in many fields, we want to see if it is also good for movie recommendation.
